# Sign3 SDK Integration Guide for Android

The Sign3 SDK is an Android-based fraud prevention toolkit designed to assess device security, detecting potential risks such as rooted devices, VPN connections, or remote access and much more. Providing insights into the device's safety, it enhances security measures against fraudulent activities and ensures a robust protection system.

## Adding Sign3SDK to Your Project

### Using Project Level Gradle Dependency

1. **Add Sign3SDK to the Dependency Block**
   - Open your project level `build.gradle` file and add the following line to the dependencies block. Please collect the **username** and **password** from credentials documents.

     ```groovy
      repositories {
          google()
          mavenCentral()
          maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
          maven {
              url "https://sign3.jfrog.io/artifactory/intelligence-generic-local/"
              credentials {
                  username = "provided in credential doc"
                  password = "provided in credential doc"
              }
          }
      }
      ```

### Using App Level Gradle Dependency

1. **Add Sign3SDK to the Dependency Block**
   - Open your app's `build.gradle` file and add the following line to the dependencies block.

     ```groovy
     dependencies {
         // For compile sdk upto 34
         implementation 'com.sign3.intelligence:intelligence-playstore:3.x.x'

         // For compile sdk > 34
         implementation 'com.sign3.intelligence:intelligence-playstore:4.x.x'

         // For lite version
         implementation 'com.sign3.intelligence:intelligence-playstore-lite:4.x.x'
     }
     ```
   - For the most recent latest version, connect with Sign3.
   - Checkout the [latest_version](https://github.com/Sign3labs/sdk-integration-guide/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#changelog)
2. **After adding the dependency, sync your project with Gradle files to ensure the library is properly integrated.**

<br>

## App Permission
   1. Add the following permissions in the Manifest file.
   2. Optional permissions are recommended to achieve higher accuracy.

```permission
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<!-- optional -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<!-- Below mentioned optional permissions are taken to calculate sim affinity to the device  -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
```

<br>

## Initializing the SDK

1. Initialize the SDK in the `onCreate()` method of your Application class.
2. Use the ClientID and Client Secret shared with the credentials document.
3. The SDK require a minimum SDK version of 23 if your app is targeting below this version must enclose Sign3 API calls within conditional checks.
4. Add the `Sign3Intelligence.stop()` method as the first line in the `onCreate()` method after super.onCreate() of the Application class, before any other initialization code as shown.

### For Kotlin

```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    if (Sign3Intelligence.stop()) return
    // Other initialisation code

    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
        val options = Options.Builder()
            .setClientId("<SIGN3_CLIENT_ID>")
            .setClientSecret("<SIGN3_CLIENT_SECRET>")
            .setEnvironment(Options.ENV_PROD) // For Prod: Options.ENV_PROD, For Dev: Options.ENV_DEV
            .build()

        Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).initAsync(options) {
            // to check if the SDK is initialized correctly or not
            Log.i("TAG_AppInstance", "Sign3Intelligence init : $it")
        }
    }

}
```

### For Java

```java
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    if (Sign3Intelligence.Companion.stop()) return;
    // Other initialisation code

    Options options = new Options.Builder()
            .setClientId("<SIGN3_CLIENT_ID>")
            .setClientSecret("<SIGN3_CLIENT_SECRET>")
            .setEnvironment(Options.ENV_PROD) // For Prod: Options.ENV_PROD, For Dev: Options.ENV_DEV
            .build();

    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
        Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).initAsync(options);
    }
}
```
<br>

## Optional Parameters
1.	You can add optional parameters like UserId, Phone Number, etc., at any time and update the instance of Sign3Intelligence.
3. Once the options are updated, they get reset. Clients need to explicitly update the options again to ingest them, or else the default value of OTHERS in userEventType will be sent to the backend.
4. You need to call **getIntelligence()** function whenever you update the options.
5. To update the Sign3Intelligence instance with optional parameters, including additional attributes, you can use the following examples.

### For Kotlin

```kotlin
// Example of Additional Attributres
val attributes = hashMapOf<String, String>()

attributes["TRANSACTION_ID"] = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
attributes["DEPOSIT"] = "<AMOUNT>"
attributes["WITHDRAWAL"] = "<AMOUNT>"
attributes["METHOD"] = "UPI/CARD/NET_BANKING/WALLET"
attributes["STATUS"] = "SUCCESS/FAILURE"
attributes["CURRENCY"] = "USD/INR/GBP/etc."
attributes["TIMESTAMP"] = "${System.currentTimeMillis()}"

val updateOptions = UpdateOptions.Builder()
        .setUserId("<user-id>") // Set user id here, you can reference the result in future
        .setPhoneNumber("<1234567890>") // you can add the customer phone number
        .setPhoneInputType(PhoneInputType.PASTED) // See PhoneInputType class
        .setOtpInputType(OtpInputType.AUTO_FILLED) // See OtpInputType class
        .setUserEventType(UserEventType.TRANSACTION) // See UserEventType class
        .setMerchantId("<merchant_id>") // Set Merchant Id
        .setAdditionalAttributes(attributes) // Set attributes to store key-value pairs.   
        .build()

Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(context).updateOptions(updateOptions)

Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).getIntelligence(object : IntelligenceListener {
   override fun onSuccess(response: IntelligenceResponse) {
        // Do something with the response
   }

   override fun onError(error: IntelligenceError) {
        // Something went wrong, handle the error message
   }
})

```

### For Java

```java
// Example of Additional Attributres
Map<String, String> attributes = new HashMap<>();

attributes.put("SIGN_UP_TIMESTAMP", String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis()));
attributes.put("SIGNUP_METHOD", "PASSWORD/OTP/SOCIAL/TRUECALLER/OTHERS");
attributes.put("REFERRED_BY", "UserID/Referral Code");
attributes.put("PREFERRED_LANGUAGE", "English/Spanish/etc.");

UpdateOptions updateOptions = new UpdateOptions.Builder()
       .setUserId("<user-id>") // Set user id here, you can reference the result in future
       .setPhoneNumber("<1234567890>") // you can add the customer phone number
       .setPhoneInputType(PhoneInputType.PASTED) //See PhoneInputType class
       .setOtpInputType(OtpInputType.AUTO_FILLED) //See OtpInputType class
       .setUserEventType(UserEventType.SIGNUP) //See UserEventType class
       .setMerchantId("<merchant_id>") // Set Merchant Id
       .setAdditionalAttributes(attributes) // Set attributes to store key-value pairs.    
       .build();

Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(context).updateOptions(updateOptions)

Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).getIntelligence(new IntelligenceListener() {
       @Override
       public void onSuccess(IntelligenceResponse response) {
           // Do something with the response
       }

       @Override
       public void onError(IntelligenceError error) {
           // Something went wrong, handle the error message
       }
});
```

## Get Session ID

1. The Session ID is the unique identifier of a user's app session and serves as a reference point when retrieving the device result for that session.
2. The Session ID follows the OS lifecycle management, in line with industry best practices. This means that a user's session remains active as long as the device maintains it, unless the user terminates the app or the device runs out of memory and has to kill the app.

### For Kotlin

 ```kotlin

val sessionId = Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).getSessionId()
```
 
### For Java

 ```java

String sessionId = Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).getSessionId()
```
<br>

## Behavioural Biometrics
The Behavioural biometrics feature in the SDK captures and analyzes how users interact with your app to build a detailed behavioral profile. It monitors device sensor data, including accelerometer, gyroscope, and other sensors, as well as touch interactions such as taps, scrolls, long presses, and additional signals. By examining these patterns, the SDK can detect unusual activity and potential fraud, helping you enhance security and gain deeper insights into user behavior.

### StartAnalyzingBehaviour

- Use this method to start capturing the userâ€™s behavioral data.
- Call it at the point in your app where you want to track interactions, such as on a specific screen or during flows like login, signup, or payment.
- The function returns a capture ID for detailed insights tracking.
- If `startAnalyzingBehaviour()` is called multiple times without calling `stopAnalyzingBehaviour()`, the same capture ID will be returned.

### For Kotlin
```start
val captureId = Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).startAnalyzingBehaviour()
```

### For Java
 ```java
String captureId = Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).startAnalyzingBehaviour()
```

### StopAnalyzingBehaviour

- Use the function below to safely halt behavioral data collection.
- Manually stop tracking at the appropriate point, such as after a user completes login, signup, or payment.
- The SDK continues collecting data until you explicitly stop it.
- Data collection will automatically stop if the app is killed, but it is recommended to stop it manually.

```stop
Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).stopAnalyzingBehaviour()
```

<br>

## Fetch Device Intelligence Result

1. To fetch the device intelligence data refer to the following code snippet.
2. IntelligenceResponse and IntelligenceError models are exposed by the SDK.

### For Kotlin

```kotlin
Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).getIntelligence(object : IntelligenceListener {
   override fun onSuccess(response: IntelligenceResponse) {
        // Do something with the response
   }


   override fun onError(error: IntelligenceError) {
        // Something went wrong, handle the error message
   }
})
```

### For Java

```java
Sign3Intelligence.getInstance(this).getIntelligence(new IntelligenceListener() {
       @Override
       public void onSuccess(IntelligenceResponse response) {
           // Do something with the response
       }


       @Override
       public void onError(IntelligenceError error) {
           // Something went wrong, handle the error message
       }
});
```
